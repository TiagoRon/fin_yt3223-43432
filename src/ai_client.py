    3. Generate VIRAL SEO METADATA (Title, Description, Tags).
    4. **TAGS OPTIMIZATION**:
       - Generate 15-20 high-traffic YouTube tags.
       - Mix broad keywords (e.g., "History", "Science") and specific long-tail keywords (e.g., "Hidden truths about Titanic").

       - **CRITICAL**: The total length of `tags_string` MUST BE under 500 characters.

    0. **Content Quality & Accuracy (CRITICAL)**: You MUST use REAL WORLD facts, REAL names of actual people, REAL anime logic/power levels, and REAL verified data. NEVER invent names or fake statistics. ZERO-TOLERANCE FOR HALLUCINATION: If you do not know the exact fact, year, or number, DO NOT invent it. Drop it and speak in general true terms. ZERO filler or generic narrative ("flojo"). NO phrases like '¡Prepárate!', 'Este video es para ti', 'Hoy te voy a contar', or any hype phrase. Every single sentence MUST hit hard with a specific fact.
    1. **Natural but Catchy Pacing (CRITICAL)**: Write natural, complete, and coherent sentences. DO NOT write confusing fragments or drop words. Sentences should be about 10 to 18 words to keep it fast-paced, but MUST be grammatically complete and make perfect sense. Visual changes happen every 2-3 seconds, so keep the narrative moving smoothly without losing coherence.
    2. **Scenes Total**: {"ONLY 2 SCENES" if is_test else "13-15 Micro-Scenes Minimum. You MUST break down every single sentence into 2-3 visual beats. For TOP 3 style: each ranked item gets at least 3-4 scenes."}
    3. **Visual Variety**: Use different angles (close-up, wide, drone) for consecutive shots.
    {loop_rule}
    5. **Stock Footage Keywords (CRITICAL SURGICAL LITERALITY - IN ENGLISH)**:
       - `visual_search_term_en` MUST be a **CONCRETE, FILMABLE, REAL OBJECT** that a camera can physically record.
       - **CONTEXTUAL SPECIFICITY**: The visual MUST relate to the core topic. If the topic is football/soccer, use "soccer stadium", "soccer ball", "soccer player", NOT generic "man running".
       - **ABSOLUTE RULE**: It MUST be EXACTLY 1 to 3 words. No commas. No adjectives. No poetry.
       - **BAD (ABSTRACT/UNFINDABLE)**: "cosmic universe stars", "warped reality", "light speed effect", "mystery", "fear", "people", "particles", "abstract", "smoke effect", "light rays", "energy", "darkness".
       - **GOOD (REAL OBJECTS)**: "ancient temple", "skull", "laboratory", "sword", "human brain", "old book", "volcano", "medieval castle", "microscope", "skeleton", "prison cell", "hospital bed".
       - **RELEVANCE**: If the text talks about death, use "cemetery" or "skull" NOT "darkness". If the text talks about mystery, use "detective" or "magnifying glass" NOT "abstract lights".
       - Match the SUBJECT of what is being discussed. Think: "what would a filmmaker actually FILM for this scene?"
       - DO NOT hallucinate related concepts. IF you exceed 3 words, the system will CRASH.
       - NEVER use specific copyrighted names here (like "Harry Potter", "Ricardo Darin", "Star Wars"). Pexels doesn't have them. Use generic terms like "wizard", "man", "spaceship".
    6. **SPECIFIC ENTITIES — visual_overlay_term (MOST CRITICAL RULE OF ALL)**:
       - ASK YOURSELF for EVERY scene: "Does this scene mention a SPECIFIC named person, movie, TV show, city, building, brand, song, athlete, politician, or historical event?"
       - If YES → `visual_overlay_term` MUST be set. No exceptions.
       - If NO (the scene talks about a completely generic concept like 'time', 'nature', 'science', 'the universe') → `visual_overlay_term` = null.
       
       MANDATORY CASES — ALWAYS set `visual_overlay_term`:
       - Any ANIME, CARTOON, or VIDEO GAME by title or character → "Dragon Ball Z anime", "Goku escena", "Super Mario Bros", "Naruto Shippuden pelea"
       - Any MOVIE or TV SHOW by title → "El Clan pelicula", "Stranger Things serie", "The Dark Knight escena" (IMPORTANT: Prioritize the TITLE of the show, NOT the actors/directors, so we see the actual show!)
       - Any REAL PERSON (politician, athlete, musician, actor) → Append 'interview' or 'face' for best results: "Lionel Messi interview", "Albert Einstein face", "Freddie Mercury live", "Guillermo Francella cara"
       - Any COMPANY or BRAND → Append 'logo' or 'b-roll' for best results: "Netflix logo b-roll", "Disney company logo", "Apple iPhone b-roll", "Ferrari F40 driving"
       - Any SPECIFIC PLACE (famous building, city, landmark) → "Torre Eiffel", "Machu Picchu", "Buenos Aires drone"
       - Any HISTORICAL EVENT → "Segunda Guerra Mundial batalla", "Revolución Francesa pintura"
       
       FORBIDDEN (NEVER put these in visual_overlay_term, use null):
       - Generic adjectives: "genius", "funny", "dramatic", "epic battle"
       - Generic concepts: "cinema", "movies", "comedy", "acting", "drama", "anime", "fight"
       - Things that are already described generically in visual_search_term_en
       
       SEARCH QUALITY: Make the term EXACT and SEARCHABLE on YouTube/Google. Include the person's full name + the specific work if relevant.
       Example: NOT "El Clan" alone. YES: "Guillermo Francella El Clan pelicula".
    7. **LANGUAGE**: 
       - The `text` (script), `title`, and `hashtags` MUST be in **{lang_name}**.
       - `visual_search_term_en` MUST be in **ENGLISH**.
    8. **CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING**: 
       - NEVER use double quotes (") inside string values. If you need quotes, use single quotes (').
       - NEVER use line breaks inside string values.
       - The `visual_overlay_term` must be `null` (lowercase boolean, without quotes) if not used, NOT "Null" or the string "null".
